 Subscription Strategy Revamp for Citi Bike Application

Business Goal:
As part of BikeStar’s Data Analytics Team, we are required to provide this analysis for 
management to decide which features or factors they should concentrate on. Management wants 
to know which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes. How well those 
variables describe the bike demands. We have been asked to model the demand for rental bikes 
with independent variables. It will be used by the company to understand how exactly the demands 
vary with different features so that management can further make their decisions to meet demand 
levels and customer’s expectations. Also, the model will be a good way to understand the demand 
dynamics of new market.

The company has recently faced a reduction in their subscriptions during the Covid19 pandemic and decided to give discounted subscriptions to their potential customers.
Our Team acted as part of Citi Bike’s Data Analytics Team, we are providing Insights for the managers to decide  the location, time  and demographics to rollout the promotion.
